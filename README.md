#Introduction to NoSQL Databases: MongoDB & Mongoose ODM.

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, which provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It allows you to define objects with a strongly-typed schema that is mapped to a MongoDB document. Mongoose provides a higher level of abstraction for MongoDB and includes built-in type casting, validation, business logic hooks, and query building.

In this documentation, we'll be looking at how we can model MongoDB data using mongoose ODM. We'll learn by building a small project where we'll be working with blog data to explore and learn how to use the Mongoose ODM library to manage a MongoDB database.

## Steps to follow to have a hands on experience on using mongoose and mongodb.

first you'll need to clone the repository.
